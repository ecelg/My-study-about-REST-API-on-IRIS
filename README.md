# My-study-about-REST-API-on-IRIS
This is about what happened on my while I was studing the REST API on IRIS - A data platform with flxible interoperability 

#### Let's talk about sth not related to coding
You may not know about me... In reality I am not a programmer and I am not good at coding... My interest is simply looking around and trying out some simple stuff (Sorry I cannot handle the complicate stuff) <br>
As I am not a programmer, don't expect me can do some technical writing here. Come on, I know here is not a place for writing novel.....me, however, just simply want to write sth in my way.
- for my future review
- for sbd might have a chance who uderstand what I am talking about
- for sbd might have some inspiration after taking a glance at my simple work
- or for sbd simplly love reading a novel about a poor code writer trying out sth that she don't know

Here thank you for your reading (maybe I am the only one reading this story)
