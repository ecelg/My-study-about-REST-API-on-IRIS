## Before starting, let's talk sth else

In the pervious session, we have setup a rest intreface which directly reach the table/class method on IRIS.

In reality, we might not only interested in querying data from IRIS only. Let's consider the following case<br>

We know that
- IRIS can connet to different systems easily
- Some interfaces can even connect by no code configuration
- it is possible to exchange messages between systems
So, who is the somebody in the above picture helping us?

To be frank, I got very confused at the beginning.... The somebody seems to be Ensamble? Interoperability? Production? BS? BP? BO??????<br>
So many names.....so confusing...<br>
Let's have a brieft idea here (I am sorry, I am still in the learning stage....)
## Session 2 - Connect the REST API interface to IRIS production
